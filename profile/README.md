## ❓ FAQ

**Q: Is this tool safe from bans?**
A: The injector uses **kernel-level obfuscation** and **signature rotation**, minimizing risk. However, no external tool can guarantee 100% safety.

**Q: Can I use it on low-end PCs?**
A: Yes, the cheat is optimized to run with minimal GPU overhead (<3% impact).

**Q: Do I need to disable antivirus?**
A: Temporarily, yes — most AVs flag injectors as false positives.

**Q: How often are updates released?**
A: Updates follow PUBG patches, usually within **24 hours** after each release.

**Q: Can I customize the ESP colors?**
A: Absolutely — use the in-game config panel or edit `/configs/esp.ini`.

## 🧩 Advanced Tips

* Combine **FOV = 45°** and **delay = 85ms** for realistic aiming.
* Disable ESP for teammates in duos/squads to reduce clutter.
* Use **Panic Mode** before alt-tabbing to avoid display freezes.

[!WARNING]
Using public versions of outdated injectors may trigger detection. Always verify your build in the official channel.
